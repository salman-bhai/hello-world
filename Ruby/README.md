## Getting Started

### Installing Ruby
* Windows: Use [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* Linux and Mac OS: the best way is to use [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install). You can also use your package manager on Linux.

You can also install from source code. Visit the [Ruby Downloads](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) to get the code.

Verify that the installation was successful by opening the command prompt and typing `ruby --version`. You should see the version of Ruby you installed.

### Running "Hello World"
This step is the same for all operating systems. Navigate to the directory containing `hello-world.rb` (you can do this from the terminal or command line using the `cd` command). Type `ruby hello-world.rb` and the console should print `Hello, world!`

**Congratulations! You've run your first Ruby program!**
