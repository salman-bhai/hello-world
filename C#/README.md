## Getting Started

### Installing Visual Studio Community Edition
* Windows: Install [Visual Studio](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download). 

### Building and running C# code
Open **VS201x Native Tools Command Prompt** and `cd` to the folder containing your `hello-world.cs` file.
After that, enter the following command to compile `hello-world.cs`.

`csc hello-world.cs`

If your program has no compilation errors, an executable file that is named `hello-world.exe` is created.

In the command-prompt window, enter the following command to run the program:

`hello-world`

**Congratulations! You've run your first C# program!**
