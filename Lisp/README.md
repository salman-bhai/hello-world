## Getting started
### Installing the Lisp compiler
You can download the clisp (Common Lisp) compiler for Linux, MacOS, and Windows from sourceforge by clicking [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clisp/). Upon downloading, follow the installation instructions for your OS.

During installation, clisp is automatically added to your PATH variable if you select the RECOMMENDED option. This means that you can simply open a new terminal window and type “clisp” to bring up the compiler.

### Building and running Lisp code
You can write your code in the editor of your choice. To run it, simply use `clisp hello-world.lisp`.

#### Congrats! You have just run your first Lisp code! :smile:
